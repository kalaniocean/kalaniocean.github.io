        <h2>Hi! My name is Adam Richardson!</h2>
        <p> I am learning to be a web developer while living in St. Augustine, FL.</p>
        <p> I am currently attempting to transition from the railroad to a field that I enjoy working daily.</p></main>

        <h2> About Adam </h2>
        <p>I have always wanted to pursue a career in the technology field since high school. Unfortunately, I could never figure out what I wanted to do exactly in that field. Eventually, before my first marriage, I had figure out I wanted to move towards coding.</p>
        <p>My willingness to work with others goes hand in hand with my strive for knowledge. I believe everyone knows something I do not know and desire to both learn and work with them. I am willing to work at various hours to meet the needs of others. It takes one person to create something good it takes a team to create something great.</p>
        <p>As a new student attending thinkful, I have already come across some personal challenges outside of school but have not stopped me from studying.</p>
